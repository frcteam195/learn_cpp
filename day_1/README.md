## C++ is a compiled language
   - Computers don't understand the human readable c++ you and I write, 
   they undestand "Machine Code".
   - C++ is compiled directly into "machine code"
   - Since different operating systems (windows, mac, linux) have different ways 
   they give access to things like keyboard and screens, machine code compiled
   for one OS cannot be trivially moved to the other
   - Compilers are programs that take our c++ code and convert it into machine code
   - Some popular compilers are:
     - g++
     - gcc
     - clang
     - visual c++ (visual studio code
